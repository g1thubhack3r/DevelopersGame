# Developers' Game
A mini SRPG game made for developers.  
This game is currently in alpha, only parts of game is available.  
For Multiplayer mode, please view [this](https://github.com/g1thubhack3r/DevelopersGameMultiplayer) repository.  
## Why AGPL?
I think that open source game should not be commerical and people should not be addicated to the game.
So I changed the license of this game to AGPL(the strongest copyleft license).
## How to complie by myself?
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make` in cloned repository's directory
## ToDo:
- Complete rewrite of weapons(enum class to struct)
- Visual fighting system
- mod support
- Complete main levels(2D map)
- Multiplayer mode (intend to use Python because of it can cross-platform)
- Write level system
- Finish max HP system
- Write skill system(probably not)
- Write critical hit system
